DocReader Library - Text File Sample

This is a sample plain text file for testing the DocReader library's text parsing capabilities.

Key Features:
- Supports multiple document formats
- Uses Apache Tika for robust parsing
- Extracts content, metadata, and file type information
- Easy integration with Ballerina applications

The DocReader library can process various document types including:
• PDF documents
• Microsoft Office files (Word, Excel, PowerPoint)
